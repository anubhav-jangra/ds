### Day - 1 (04/06/2018)
* Heaps (==Finally something worth it...well atleast according to me..==)

## Day - 2 (06/06/2018)
* AVL Trees (==well there was this question on hackerrank, ill make an official code later tomorrow==)
(==Well what do ya know i did implement it today itself....==)

### Day - 3 (12/06/2018)
* Implemented some more stuff in min heap to make it work alongside of huffman coding

### day - 4 (13/06/2018)
* started graphs

### day - 5 (14/06/2018)
* graphs
    * adjacency matrix
    * adjacency list
    * breadth first search
    * depth first search
    * DFS applications
        * minimum spanning trees for unweighted graph
        * Cycle detection in O(V)

### day - 6 (15/06/2018)
* graphs
    * DFS applications
        * find a path between two nodes
        * topological sorting
